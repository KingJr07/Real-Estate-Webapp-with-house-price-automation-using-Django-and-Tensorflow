**Real Estate Web App with House Price Automation using Django and TensorFlow**

This project utilizes Django for building the web application framework and integrates TensorFlow for automating house price predictions.

**Features:**

* Django-powered real estate web app with user authentication, property listings, and search functionality.
* TensorFlow model integration for predicting house prices based on various features.
* Ability to add/edit/delete property listings through a user-friendly interface.
* Interactive map visualization of available properties and their predicted prices.
* Secure and scalable application architecture.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.x
* Django web framework
* TensorFlow deep learning library
* PostgreSQL database (optional)
* GeoDjango library (optional)
* Leaflet.js library for map visualization (optional)

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/bard/real_estate_web_app.git
```
2. Install the required libraries:
```
pip install django tensorflow
pip install psycopg2 (optional)
pip install django-geoip django-leaflet (optional)
```
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
4. Install the project requirements within the virtual environment:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Create and configure the database (if using PostgreSQL):
```
psql -U postgres
CREATE DATABASE real_estate_db;
\q
python manage.py migrate
```
6. Run the development server:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

**Usage:**

1. Access the web application at `http://localhost:8000/` in your web browser.
2. Register a new user or log in with existing credentials.
3. Explore the available property listings and search for specific features.
4. Use the interactive map to visualize property locations and their predicted prices.
5. Add/edit/delete your own property listings (if logged in).

**Model Training:**

1. Download a dataset containing house price information and relevant features.
2. Train a TensorFlow model for house price prediction using the provided scripts or your preferred training routine.
3. Integrate the trained model into the application by updating the relevant settings and configurations.

**Further Enhancements:**

* Implement user roles and access control mechanisms.
* Integrate additional data sources like property images and virtual tours.
* Offer advanced search filters and sorting options.
* Develop a machine learning pipeline for automated data cleaning and feature engineering.
* Integrate with external APIs for real-time data updates and market trends.

**Contributing:**

We welcome contributions to this project. You can fork the repository and submit pull requests with your improvements and suggestions.

**Disclaimer:**

This project is a starting point and may require further development and customization based on your specific needs and requirements. The accuracy of house price predictions depends on the quality of the training data and the chosen model architecture.
